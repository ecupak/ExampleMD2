Model description       : This is the YF-19 prototype for the
                          VF-19 Excalibur variable fighter from
                          the animated series Macross Plus.

Other info              : Just a straight up adaptation of the
		          YF-19 battroid, with a Studio HalfEye
                          1/100 scale resin model used for 
                          reference.  I tried to keep it as 
                          accurate as possible, but there's only 
                          so much curvature you can imply inside 
                          800 polys.

Additional Credits to   : Muchos nachos to id Softtware for 
                          giving me reason to live and Kawamori
                          Shoji for the entire Macross series. 

Thanks to               : Thanks a ton to rogue13 and the guys 
                          at the Q2PMP site for lotsa help with
                          my first model.

                          Extra special thanks to Dan Bickell,
                          who really helped me big time with all
                          my modeling woes. 
                          
                          Finally, thanks to my friend Aaron 
                          "Mighty Bert" Rucker, who got me 
                          hooked on Quake2, 3DS MAX, and
                          Japanese animation - I'd never have 
                          gotten started without ya...
